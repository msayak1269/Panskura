				<h2>Etymology</h2>
				<p>According to many references, the name Panskura have been originated from the word "Panchkoora". The king of Kasijora once gave some land to the poet Nityanand Chakrabarty at the time of his ‘Diksha’. This evidence is found in the kabyo (book) of Manikram Gangopadhyay's 'Shitala Mangal' - 'Panchakurya jami dilo karya bramhottar’. The meaning of 'Pancha' is five and 'kurya' means the amount of land situated in a river valley. It is actually a Persi term. ‘The name 'Panskura' has come from this ‘Panchakurya’ through evolution.</p>
				<p> According to Regional History researcher Shyamal Bera, "The steamers transported through the Midnapore canal and came to Kangsabati (now South Gopalpur Mouza) and used to throw ‘Pans’ [ashes] and collects ‘Kura’ [fuel]. Since then, the name of the area seems to have been formed into Panskua [Pans+Kura]."</p>
